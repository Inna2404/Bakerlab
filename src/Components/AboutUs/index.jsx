              Like many design teams, Onfido made the transition from Abstract +
              Sketch, to Figma in the last couple of years. One of the common
              resistance points internally before making that switch, was
              Figmaâ€™s lack of Git-style branching that Abstract enabled. The
              design team had come to rely on branching and had built a lot of
              our processes around it.
